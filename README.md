## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Write about 1-2 paragraphs describing the purpose of your project.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Here's what you need to get started

Runtime

```
Nodejs V8+
```

Database

```
MongoDB Atlas
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Create a database on [MongoDB Atlas](mongodb.com)

```
Create a connection string
```

Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/RileySeaburg/url-shortener.git
```

Navigate to cloned project

```
cd url-shortener
```

Replace baseUrl with your localhost url & mongoUri with your mongoDB connection string.

```
vi config/default.json
```

Save file

```
:wq
```

Run Server

```
npm start
```

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

This is just the backend so the best bet is to test with postman.

### Break down into end to end tests

Test the urlshortener

```
POST http://baseUrl/api/url/shorten
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "longUrl": "insert link here."
}
```

### Test New Url

After you create the url it should be available to test.

```
Navigate to "shortUrl"
```
